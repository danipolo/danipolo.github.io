I'm a journalist, a SEO specialist, and a environmentalist. I've spent the past five years working as an Editor for news site such as the PublicWire and Z6Mag. In 2015, I took the Project Manager position for an IT agency called Astute Dynamics. Since then, I've been micromanaging businesses and providing effective strategies to expand business models.
